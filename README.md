  <!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
The following project is that demonstrates a few different ways to perform Webscrapping.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have these packages installed below. You will need to run these in terminal if you are on Mac or commpand prompt if you are on Windows.

*pip install requests
```sh
pip install requests
```

*pip install beautifulsoup4
```sh
pip install beautifulsoup4
```

### Installation
You will need Juypter Notebook or any programming environment you prefer. I recommend Juypter Notebook. It is what I used to perform webscrapping.
```sh
https://jupyter.org/
```
You can always download anaconda. It is free platform and includes juypter notebook.

```sh
https://www.anaconda.com/
```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
You can use these Juypter Notebooks to teach yourself how to perform webscrapping and experiment on scrapping other data from websites on your own.


## Future Versions
I plan to work on a new version of this webscrapper to include moving this data into a Database. I'm also planning on demonstrating turning that data into a data frame with pandas and performing some analysis. I might even turn it into a separate project. If I do, I will provide a link to it here.
